# Meditate with Friends #



<!-- 

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for each heading. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

## Heading ##
  Meditate with Friends / Group Meditation / Meta-Meditation

## Sub-Heading ##
  
Bringing people together in a meditative community. 

## Summary ##

  Encourage yourself and others in meditative practices by joining groups, or just join the community by meditating where ever you are. 

## Problem ##

  Group meditation fosters a wide-spread peace and mindfulness for those directly involved and even tangentially involved. However, meditation in public is rare; people may be discouraged from doing so if they feel they are the only ones. 

## Solution ##

  By adding a community around people who meditate, people can support each other and gather in public - both fulfilling their own practices and raising the public awareness in general. 

## Quote from You ##
  
A sense of community in meditation has long been considered an essential part of continuing practice and participation. This app extends your meditative community. 


## How to Get Started ##

  At a basic level, this app simply registers where you are on a map and signifies if you are 'on' or 'off'. The map displays all users who are 'on'.

## Customer Quote ##
  
  This app encourages my own meditative practices. When I see people in my area are meditating, I am more likely to do so myself. It can also be a good way to meet good, like-minded people. 

## Closing and Call to Action ##

Try the app yourself. Emit your meditative energy to the world and see those who join you.
